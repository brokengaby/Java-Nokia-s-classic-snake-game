# Java-Nokia-s-classic-snake-game
Open n Play Java Snake Version

A simple but nice (I think) Java Netbeans Project that allow us to play the classic nokiaÂ´s snake game. This is the first commit, and actually my first repo, I'll be working
on an initial menut for selecting differente color schemes, selecting the grid size and also the snake speedness. Visuals are made thinking of an old game look.
